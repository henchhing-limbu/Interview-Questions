# Introduction
This repository contains solutions along with explainations to leetcode questions as well as programming questions from
other sites. Instead of just posting a solution to the problem, I have tried to explain the logic behind the solution.

The reason I wanted to create this repo is to make give everyone access to popular questions in leetcode and other
sites. Leetcode alone has more than 1200 questions which is almost impossible for students to go through. I have tried
to take some questions from each topic and create a smaller subset of the questions.
