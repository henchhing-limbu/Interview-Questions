"""
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

# TODO(henxing): Implement this algorithm.
# Required time complexity is O(log n).
# This must be a binary search problem.

# Do Binary search to find the target number first.
# Do binary search on left side to find left < target
# Do binary search on right side to find right > target
