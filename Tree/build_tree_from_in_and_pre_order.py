"""
Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Return the following binary tree:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
"""

# The solution is similar to building tree from inorder and postorder traversal
# Instead of postorder, we look in preorder traversal for the root of the tree
# or subtree.
